Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Wrong createuser switch in the documentation
Message-ID: <1317656759.1989.12.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

http://slony.info/documentation/2.1/tutorial.html#FIRSTDB says to launch
"createuser -A -D..." but there's no -A switch to createuser since 8.1.
The (quite simple) attached patch fixes this for master. It should also
be backpatched to 2.0, and 1.2. But, in 1.2, it would probably be better
to add a paragraph saying the two different options.

Regards.

Message-ID: <mailman.7.1317656763.6915.slony1-hackers@lists.slony.info>

With PostgreSQL 8.1 and later, the -A switch is replaced with -S. We add -R
and -D to make sure the user doesn't have the CREATEDB and CREATEROLE
attributes.

This patch has been applied against master, REL_2_0_STABLE and with some 
changes to REL_1_2_STABLE

Thanks

Hi,

Sorry for the late response. I can confirm that it did not break
anything on Fedora 15 and RHEL 6.

Regards,

Hi

Here is my little contribution for Slony 2.1.0.

I've converted the Slony documentation to PDF using dblatex (dblatex.sf.net).

The documentation is available at http://www.davidgis.fr/documentation/slony/2.1.0/pdf/slony-2.1.0.pdf

I did not attached the PDF to the mail (big file? 1M even if compressed).

Let me know if you want to put it on slony.info :)


Hope this help.

David.

Thanks for the work!

I really want to see it in slony.info, so that I can push this PDF along
with RPMs.
