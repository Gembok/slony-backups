Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Unsafe coding in recent commit
Message-ID: <87k5vighd2.fsf@oxford.xeocode.com>


The coding below from a recent commit to xxid.c is unfortunately unsafe.
Packed varlenas are unaligned (even if the datum itself is aligned the data
within will be unaligned since it follows a 1-byte header). That means
snap->nxip which is an integer and should be 4-byte aligned on most
architectures will land on random alignments.

In fact since the struct itself will require 4-byte alignment the compiler may
not be happy with accessing even single bytes from it if it's in a packed
varlena and stored unaligned.

In short, it's sad but you can't use PG_DETOAST_DATUM_PACKED unless you really
don't care about the alignment of the data which means basically it's only
useful for data like text and bytea which contain just unaligned bytes. Or
perhaps for functions that are just going to memcpy or memcmp the data without
accessing fields within it.

The alternative is to mark the data type as typstorage 'p' which disables
packed storage altogether. That might make sense if you store relatively few
such data and process them frequently so the cpu costs of copying them is
actually greater than the i/o costs of storing padding bytes. int2vector and
oidvector are set like that in part for reasons like that (plus others).

typedef struct
{
	TransactionId xmin;
	TransactionId xmax;
	int			nxip;
	TransactionId xip[1];
}	xxid_snapshot;

...

Datum
_Slony_I_xxid_snapshot_out(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
	xxid_snapshot *snap = (xxid_snapshot *) VARDATA_ANY(PG_DETOAST_DATUM_PACKED((PG_GETARG_DATUM(0))));

	char	   *str = palloc(28 + snap->nxip * 13);
...

I see. This data type currently is nowhere stored in the DB by Slony, it 
is just handed around in memory, but it is probably a good idea to not 
make any assumptions about alignment even then.

I'll fix it. Thanks for pointing that out.

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION proposal for 2.0
Message-ID: <60y7jx8zew.fsf@dba2.int.libertyrms.com>

One of the "ToDo" items was to create a way of cancelling a
subscription in progress, as people (somewhat) frequently fall into
the "hole" of having some attempt at a subscription in progress for a
while, which then keeps breaking, and which then blocks anything else
from happening on that node.

Here's an outline of an approach to the issue; if you see holes in
this, feel free to comment...

What we thus do is to create a new Slonik command, CANCEL
SUBSCRIPTION.

  cancel subscription (id=2, receiver=4, event node=3);

This command will inject a CANCEL_SUBSCRIPTION event at event node #3
which will cancel any SUBSCRIBE SET events for set #2 on node #4.

1.  SUBSCRIBE SET event "hook"

We would then add a "hook" at the beginning of the code that detects
SUBSCRIBE SET events; this hook would search the provider node to see
if it has any CANCEL_SUBSCRIPTION events for the set in question that
are newer than the present SUBSCRIBE_SET event.  If that be the case,
it would not bother performing anything further of the subscription.[1]

There wind up being two possibilities:

- Supposing the SUBSCRIBE SET wasn't yet in progress when the CANCEL
  SUBSCRIPTION request came in, no (further) attempt would be made to
  set up the subscription.  Perfect!  That's exactly what we asked for.

- Alternatively, it is possible that the SUBSCRIBE SET request may
  have already completed.  If the subscription was in progress at the
  time that the CANCEL request came in, there isn't much of a way (short
  of polling periodically inside the code that processes this) to force
  cancellation.  One might force this by signalling the slon with
  SIGTERM/SIGKILL; when it restarts, the re-attempt to process the event
  would take us back to the first case...

  ... But absent of that, the subscription may indeed complete.
  We nonetheless need to eliminate the subscription as other nodes will
  likely by this time have been informed of the elimination of this
  subscription.  [2]

  Thus, we need to perform the equivalent to "UNSUBSCRIBE SET" at that
  point.

2.  SYNC event "hook"

We'll wind up needing a similar hook in SYNC to what's in SUBSCRIBE
SET, I think, so that if there is an outstanding CANCEL_SUBSCRIPTION
for the local node's subscription, we arrange to do the equivalent to
"UNSUBSCRIBE SET".

3.  CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION event

On the node where the set is, this will either be a NO-OP, if the
subscription is already cancelled, or this will do "UNSUBSCRIBE SET,"
as with the earlier hooks on SUBSCRIBE SET and SYNC, if it is still
active.

On nodes other than the receiver node for the subscription, the CANCEL
SUBSCRIPTION event would perform the equivalent to "UNSUBSCRIBE SET"
to indicate the cancellation of the subscription.[3]

Footnotes: 

[1] Note that if someone accidentally submitted a whole series of
SUBSCRIBE SET requests, it only takes ONE request to CANCEL
SUBSCRIPTION to turn them all into NOOPs.

[2] Note that we can't simply say "Oh, the subscription *DID* work,
we'll keep that!" as the effect of CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION will have been
to drop info about the subscription from other nodes.  We *must* kill
off the subscription even though it might have worked.

[3] Open question: Should the CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION event wait until its
location in sequence to be processed on the other nodes (e.g.  - nodes
other than the specified receiver), or should we have it invoked via
the hook in SYNC?  I'm not certain...

Uh... in light of the below (and a bunch of other bug-fixes), is there any
interest in cutting a 1.2.10 release?

Not as of right now. I am still working on getting log shipping working 
right in both, HEAD and REL_1_2_STABLE. But as soon as that is done I 
think a 1.2.10 is due.

I'm the one who has been writing them up, and I have no particular
objection to the merge.  So go ahead!

Hmm.  It'll only become REL_1_2_9 if you check out that particular
release.  And it becomes REL_1_2_10 when CVS gets tagged as such, and
a copy is checked out at that particular release level.

In the interim, I think it's probably right for the version to appear
to be REL_1_2_STABLE...  That's not actually a release...

Is there some other handling with PostgreSQL that simulates a release
number when checking out a major branch?

We were playing around with Slony 1.3.  Am I missing something or is there
no target in the Makefile to uninstall?  I'm no gmake expert, but I couldn't
find anything.

You can, but you just need to build them form the correct tag

Is that the code that just got committed this morning? If so, is it time to
start kicking .10 out the door?

That is that very code. I encourage everyone who is interested in file 
based log shipping to start testing with REL_1_2_STABLE so that we know 
ASAP if the branch is really ready for 1.2.10.
