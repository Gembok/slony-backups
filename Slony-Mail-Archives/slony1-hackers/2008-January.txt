Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Locating the share directory
Message-ID: <937d27e10801071246k4b261d84tde00839087a803ae@mail.gmail.com>

We ran into a problem with the EDB-Postgres installer on Linux in
which Slonik couldn't find the scripts to initialise a cluster. The
problem turned out to be that the share directory is defined by the
configure script at build time - which resolved to our build staging
directory and obviously not the directory the user opted to install to
on his own mchine.

This problem doesn't exist on Windows which we intentionally coded
such that it was fully relocatable. Is there any reason not to have
other platforms query Postgres for the share directory at runtime, per
the attached patch? Obviously this requires sharing the Postgres share
directory at all times, but does anyone ever do anything different?

Regards, Dave.

Hmm.

Well, the relevant files do all get installed in
$(DESTDIR)$(pgsharedir) (see src/backend/Makefile, in the "install"
target), so $(pgsharedir) seems like the apropos place for slonik to
go look for them.

I don't see a problem with that...

FYI, it's worth noting that:

 a) I'll see about releasing a 1.2.13 as soon as PostgreSQL 8.3 gets
    released, as there are a few minor relevant changes, so now's a
    rather convenient time to get this into the 1.2 branch.

 b) It'll presumably need to get applied to head, too...

Yup. That was just a quick patch against a tarball I had to hand. Are
you OK to apply/merge it to head and the 1.2 branch? I still haven't
had my commit privs restored since CVS moved :-(

I'll see about applying that tomorrow, to both branches.

Evidently Darcy has been too busy getting the RPM Buildfarm up to see
about getting you added to have CVS privileges.  *I* have no
objections, so you should probably pester Darcy or Devrim, who have
root access...

  IIRC (now forgive me I may be off base) but all we are waiting on is ssh 
keys from Dave and we can have him up and running in short order..

You probably want to add some very important detail information to that.

It is very essential that the slonik script not only does a "wait for 
event" for the original "clone prepare". But it also must issue a "sync" 
on every existing node other than the provider and wait at least until 
all those sync events have been confirmed by the provider. Otherwise it 
is possible for the clone to miss some events.

Good point; I did not realize that!

I have added that to the docs; will commit to CVS when I commit the
"NG test" that I'm working on.
