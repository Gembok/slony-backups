Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Broken builds with make install DESTDIR
Message-ID: <CD28FF50E73C3E073F402908@imhotep.credativ.de>


I found it quite annoying today that slony doesn't build properly with

./configure --prefix=/dba/special/dir <--some-other-foo-magic>
make
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/test/dir

when building against a 'virtual' postgresql installation done with DESTDIR 
as well. This leads to a totally broken install directory layout, ending up 
with files scattered in different directories. The attached diff shows the 
most important changes i've done against config/acx_libpq.m4 to get that 
running, mostly because it doesn't allow overriding pgpkglibdir with an 
non-existing directory.

There are some minor issues open, but i would like to hear opinions before 
continuing to prepare a general patch to make that work. It would be 
useful, since building PostgreSQL works quite well that way and i think 
it's a common task to build RPMs as well.

I have added this to Bugzilla...

http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17

If you set up a bugzilla account, there, I'd be happy to assign it to
you :-).

I don't have any strong opinions on this, as:

  a) In the environments I'm involved with, we use plain builds from
     sources, so

  b) I don't make any use of packages such as RPMs.

I'm cc'ing Devrim Gunduz and Peter Eisentraut, as they are involved
with RPM/Debian packages, so would presumably have more relevant
opinions.

Done (look for mailings@oopsware.de).

I've already talked to Peter and parts of the patches are shamelessly 
stolen from its debian package (well, that's why i have talked to him ;).

Building with DESTDIR works so far, however there's one issue open i have 
to get back to....

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Revisions to SYNC grouping handling
Message-ID: <607ijz5p8s.fsf@dba2.int.libertyrms.com>

It seems warranted to do some cleaning up of the handling of SYNC
grouping in -HEAD, as what is there now has a confusion of
embarassment of riches in quantity of possible policy...

There are a bunch of grouping-related options at present that seem to
interact somewhat confusingly...

- sync_group_maxsize - default 20, min 0, max 10000
- desired_sync_time  - default 60000ms, min 0ms (which shuts this off), max 6000000ms

It then interacts in a somewhat complex fashion, where we tend to
start with processing 1 SYNC, then doubling and adding 1, with
[various attempts to set upper limits].

In some testing one of my colleagues was doing recently, it seemed to
be interacting in a fashion that made it appear as though the
configuration parameters were not all being considered.

I'm going to throw this out to the -hackers list, for comment
*without* yet tossing out the further thoughts that I have; I'll
comment further on that next week.
