Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Choosing the slony-I test temp output directory
Message-ID: <47F35B3F.2050407@Sun.COM>


Hi

I am running the slony tests(1.2.13/1.2.14) on Solaris n there are some =

temporary files/directories which are getting created into /tmp directory.
Now even when I set TMPDIR to some other directory,the issue remains the =

same.
As I want the temp files to be created into the directory of my =

choice, I have created a patch(run_test.sh on 1.2.14) for this, which check=
s =

into TMPDIR first. I have attached the patch with the mail.

Regards
Nirbhay

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] ACCEPT_SET bug in 1.2.13
Message-ID: <EF02765205E37008CA54AA9E@imhotep.credativ.de>

I am referring to the following report:

<http://lists.slony.info/pipermail/slony1-general/2008-March/007655.html>

Do we agree that this error affects version 1.2.12 and above only, or is 
this a longer outstanding bug  we haven't discovered before? Besides 
Yoshiharu Mori changes in his patch i don't see any related differences in 
the code base below 1.2.12.

I have taken a slightly different approach to this, and am adding
documentation for the notion of (possibly!) needing to set TMPDIR in
your environment.  I have put this into CVS HEAD...

Here's a link to the ViewCVS view of the code:

http://main.slony.info/viewcvs/viewvc.cgi/slony1-engine/src/backend/slony1_funcs.c?view=markup

The relevant code fragment:

	if (SerializableSnapshot == NULL)
		elog(ERROR, "Slony-I: SerializableSnapshot is NULL in createEvent()");

If you remove SerializableSnapshot, that code will obviously need
rejigging; we'd appreciate hearing what would be the analagous
functionality in a "post-SerializableSnapshot world."

I finally got around to reviewing this; the changes seem to be pretty
sound, with a pretty big caveat discussed at the end...

Assumption (which I validated in our conversation today): We need to
add the very same logtrigger() function to an "ON TRUNCATE" trigger.

Obvious extra bits of implementation:
- Need for function alterTableAddTriggers() in
  src/backend/slony1_funcs.sql to consider adding the ON TRUNCATE
  trigger.

  At first blush, it looks like this needs to be in an
  exception-handling block, so that we can fairly transparently
  accomodate the issue of whether or not the backend supports ON
  TRUNCATE triggers.

  Similar changes to alterTableDropTriggers()...

- Need to add documentation; it may not need to be extensive, but just
  declare that we now support TRUNCATE, if the origin node does.

- Testing: It should be easy enough to make a copy of the base
  "test1", and throw in a TRUNCATE and ensure that works.

  Making this torturous would involve something like:
   BEGIN;
     INSERT [A values] into t_table;
     TRUNCATE t_table;
     INSERT [B values] into t_table;
     TRUNCATE t_table;
     INSERT [C values] into t_table;
     TRUNCATE t_table;
     INSERT [D values] into t_table;
   COMMIT;

We of course need for t_table to contain "set D" of values...

There is, however, a significant complication to be had, in that there
are two special forms of TRUNCATE that can take place:

  a) TRUNCATE [list of multiple tables]

  b) TRUNCATE [tables] CASCADE

The TRUNCATE may need to be reverted into a DELETE if a foreign key
constraint causes TRUNCATE to fail.

And if we have multiple TRUNCATEs that came in, consecutively, we may
need to apply them as a single request in order to avoid running afoul
of foreign key restrictions that mandated the multiplicity in the
first place.  I sure hope that the multiple TRUNCATES would be
consecutive in sl_log_N...

This may mandate having the "peephole optimization" that we have the
ability to group multiple TRUNCATE requests together...  That's
potentially a rather significant complication...

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Multi-master Slony
Message-ID: <1209571981.4391.573.camel@ebony.site>

I've been waiting for a while now to unveil something I worked on for a
client. It seems now that work is potentially not open-sourceable, but
the concepts can at least be discussed here.

What I worked out involves:

* How to alter the Slony architecture to support multi-master. Rather
than play with Slony, I rewrote the basic framework so that it supported
2 node multi-master. (That has been working and in production somewhere
you will all have heard of for some months now).

* How to make the replication "pluggable", so that if one node fails we
can just add another node and have it work out the rest

So, discussion point: Is multi-master a future implementation option for
Slony?

Oh, that's it?  That's easy -- just check the "FirstSnapshotSet"
boolean.  This is not on the current code; it will be introduced by the
patch I'm about to post.
