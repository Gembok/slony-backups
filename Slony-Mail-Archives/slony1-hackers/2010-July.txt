I haven't tested it, but from the diff it seems that slon_kill.pl message
still needs some fixing.

http://main.slony.info/viewcvs/viewvc.cgi/slony1-engine/tools/altperl/slon_kill.pl?r1=1.14&r2=1.15&diff_format=h

This might cause messages like:
<when killing watchdog>
No slon_watchdog _watchdog  is running for the cluster mycluster!

OR
<when killing slon>
No slon_watchdog   is running for the cluster mycluster!

Also, there are spurious spaces before the word "is"; 2 when killing
watchdog, and 3 when killing slon.

Regards,

Thanks,

I've checked in a change for this.

Let me know if you still see issues.

Slony replication check,

in section "5.2. Nagios  Replication Checks" on

I just finished slon_ctl.pl script, which simply starts, stops and also
checks status of slon daemon(s). It is attached.

Usage: slon_ctl [--config file] [start | stop | status ]
       [--watchdog | --nowatchdog] [--sleep seconds] [node#]

It is mostly a copy-paste from slon_start, slon_stop and slon_status
scripts.

I'm not a Perl guy, so I'll be happy if someone checks the code and
functionality.

perl slon_ctl --config slon_tools.ssinger.conf start node1
works

perl slon_ctl --config slon_tools.ssinger.conf status node1
Mode: status

There is no such node.


perl slon_ctl --config slon_tools.ssinger.conf stop node1
Mode: stop

Usage: slon_ctl [--config file] [start | stop | status ]



So start works, but stop and status don't


What is the plan for the slon_start and slon_kill perl scripts, I'd like 
to see a big more code reuse between them (unless the plan is to replace 
them, but I am not sure how well that will go over with people that 
actually use the perl tools)

On the perl style side, I'd prefer to see perl code that works with 'use 
strict' (ie declares variables).  I also don't like using the global 
scope ie shutoff_processes could return $found instead of changing 
variable defined outside the function)

I wonder why we need to have a fourth implementation of this,
considering that we already have:

1. start_slon.sh, which is actually used as part of the regression
   tests, thereby giving us *some* confidence that it usually works.

    http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=slony1-engine.git;a=blob_plain;f=tools/start_slon.sh;hb=refs/heads/master

2. launch_clusters.sh
    http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=slony1-engine.git;a=blob_plain;f=tools/launch_clusters.sh;hb=refs/heads/master

3. A whole project, slony1_ctl
   http://pgfoundry.org/projects/slony1-ctl/

When we already have three, I'd imagine that we ought to consider
retiring at least a couple of them if the existing choices are somehow
so bad that it's evidently worthwhile to implement yet another init
script from scratch.

I realize that replication is such a fun thing that we evidently needed
to implement a whole bunch of replication solutions for PostgreSQL; it
doesn't seem likely to me that the same should apply to "init scripts"
for Slony-I.

Hi,

Weird. I have tested it on my machine. I will look.

*My* plan is to add slon_ctl to 2.0 branch, so that package maintainers
can write a reliable init script easily. For HEAD, my vote is removing
slon_start, slon_kill and slon_status, and only use slon_ctl. For
backwards compatibility, we can symlink slon_ctl to slon_start, etc, and
call start,stop,status routine based on the command name.

That is beyond my perl skills :)

Jan,

This commit (against the 1.2 branch)
http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=slony1-engine.git;a=commit;h=2705654ec3dcb0381afef591756170c6de8f8ce2

doesn't look like it was applied to 2.0.

Do you remember if the issue was addressed some other way in 2.0 or do 
we need to bring this fix to 2.0 (and head/master)

I don't, but I will test if the same broken logic exists in 2.0.

Thanks.

Some my failover tests are failing with 2.0 but pass with this fix in. 
I've merged +committed it into REL_2_0_STABLE and master.
