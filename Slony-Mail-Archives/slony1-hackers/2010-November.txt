The slony manual recommends that your slon nodes be synchronized with 
NTP.  If the VM has issues getting the correct time from the VM host 
then you might be better running NTP on the VM host.

If your going to be time-traveling your servers then you should restart 
slon in between.

Thanks, Steve. So looks like the only solution is we have to restart slon
service when NTP causes time shift. However, if some events are generated
with the timestamp in the future, after slon service restart, will these
events be handled or still need to wait until that time since the events
timestamp don't changes?

Note that on Windows NTP cannot skew the clock and is forced to act via 
step adjustment. Under normal conditions, this should only set the clock 
forward/backward by a second or so. Jumping suddenly 7 hours is far from 
normal.

Aside from that, slony doesn't use any of the timestamps in its tables 
for replication purposes. They are purely for outside monitoring. After 
restarting your slon processes replication will work just fine.

Hi Jan,

Thanks for your response. In my use case with Linux platform, the time will
shift a large interval according to the NTP protocol design. After first
time sync, the following sync would be relatively small and we can ignore in
slony.

I think the issue is not in slony tables for replication but in slon
schedule thread itself during waiting and checking. The schedule thread will
not response to any event if there has a big time shift backward.

In above case, if there has any time monitor mechanism to check there has a
big time change, then notify schedule thread to refresh its memory cache.
Restart slon process also work in this case but might not that graceful.

Thanks,
Jason

The tar for 2.0.5 is missing the generated files.

See the discussion at http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=164

You can either instal flex+bison or I've attached the missing files to 
that bug.

Would it be better to have that link to a wiki page, ie 
http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Slony_Roadmap  (or a better named wiki 
page)? (I say yes)

The number of people who can edit pages on the website is very small.

As we discuss these ideas on the mailing lists I'd like to do things 
like add links to the discussion threads, and some ideas might get 
rejected (or implemented).  Maintenance of a wiki page is far easier 
than the slony website.

So why didn't we release 2.0.6 immediately?

Yeah I kust remembered it.

It won't work, since the flex version is 2.5.4 in RHEL5.

It is too much work for packaging...

Still, I believe we need to release 2.0.6 (or 2.0.5.1, whatever...) to
get rid of this issue.

Everyone who mentioned the issue seemed happy with installing flex. No 
one asked until now.

I'd ask if I were not at PgWest and if I was not busy with 9.0 RPMs
already :-)
