We are planning on tagging and packing some new slony releases in the 
next little while (early next week maybe?).  The plan is for a point 
release for both 1.2 and 2.0

If there are any outstanding patches that haven't been committed or let 
us know and we'll try to look at them (I applied a few this week).

I'd also encourage people to grab the code from CVS to do some 
pre-release testing, though we will tag release candidates before 
tagging the actual release.

When is this scheduled exactly? I am planning to perform a Slony-I
production installation soon -- that's why I'm asking :)

The plan is to tag + package release candidates late this afternoon 
(eastern North American time).  If we get some successful reports from 
the release candidate we could package an actual release in a few days?

Yes, I think we were planning on doing another 2.0.3RC (today) then a 
actual 2.0.3 release once we get some good vibes from it.  A number of 
issues with the last 2.0.3rc have been fixed and I think it needs 
another RC before an actual release.

I can give them a shot in our testing environment.

Is anyone else getting cache lookup failure with 1.2.21-rc1? I got this
twice when installing a fresh test cluster today, but now it worked in
the 3rd try. Sounds a bit weird.

Nevermind. I bet it is pgbouncer. I'll skip pgbouncer while using
Slony-I.

Everything looks ok so far. I'm replicating between RHEL (5.5) and
Debian (Lenny). Both are running 8.4.3. 

Just a FYI.

It might be worth figuring out (documenting?) what issue causes that.

It *might* be something we could address on the Slony-I side; not sure.

Hi,

Juste wanted to inform you that:

 * The website still shows 1.2.20 and 2.0.2 download links.
 * The documentation is still 2.0.3-RC2.

An update would be a good thing :)

Give me a few more days. I am now using 1.2.21 on production w/o any
issues -- but I am not connecting through pgbouncer. I will test 2.0.3
on Monday on our test machines, and I'll let you know about the result.

Still, I'm pretty sure that pgbouncer caused the issue, and I'll prepare
a small doc patch after testing.

REgards,

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] PATCH more memory leaks
Message-ID: <4BDACE17.6000403@astaro.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

finally I found the memory leak I was searching for:

The remoteListenThread is subscribed to notifications events,
however the events are never removed from the queue.

Don't know if the postgresql notifications are still needed,
because they got removed in slony1-2. I added a simple
+       while ((notification = PQnotifies(conn->dbconn)) != NULL)
+               PQfreemem(notification);
but maybe the whole listen/unlisten statements can be removed anyway ??

I also removed the "SlonDString lsquery" variable in
remoteWorkerThread_main,
seems not to be used.


@Steve Singer: Thanks for your feedback, moved the dstring_free()
call after the while loop.


In 2.0.3 I found some other memory leaks. Also there seems to be a
typo in cleanupThread_main():
- -                               vrc = PQresultStatus(res);
+                               vrc = PQresultStatus(res2);

Best regards,
 Ulrich

Are you talking about a further Slony 2.0.3RC, before the actual
release of 2.0.3?
