Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Slony-I Communications Costs
Message-ID: <932147FBA0722CEA5F821732@imhotep.credativ.de>

The Slony-I documentation states the following:


"This points to it being a bad idea to have the large communications 
network resulting from the number of nodes being large. Up to a half dozen 
nodes seems pretty reasonable; every time the number of nodes doubles, this 
can be expected to quadruple communications overheads."

Consider a setup with dozens of very small nodes which aren't heavliy 
frequented. Neither of these nodes is considered to be a forwarder and 
stores only information which aren't updated frequently (so we consider a 
small database between 20 - 30 MB).  The Lagtime can be minutes (we don't 
care wether 5 or 15 minutes). The network is stable.

I wonder wether the number of nodes can be significantly larger than the 
half dozens the documentation mentions, especially if you don't need to use 
Failover, MOVE SET and you are able to use high SYNC timeouts values. For 
example, this can be configuration clusters of a large network where 
configuration changes needs to be propagated through a large number of 
nodes.

A customer is planning such a setup and they consider Slony-I exactly for 
this purpose since they are impressed about its reliability. However, 
because communications cost is quadratic, there can be significant network 
traffic.

Opinions? Experiences?

Hello all,

 

Is there a way to instruct Slony-I about comment lines that should not
be executed when utilizing the tool?

 

In code below, the "This is a comment" line and the following should be
ignored.

 

How do we accomplish that.

 

Thanks,

 

Tony Fernandez

I'm not sure I understand the problem.

Are you experiencing some problem where comments in stored functions
are not being handled as comments?

If you are, then a bug report might lead either to a fix, or to some
suggestion of a workaround.

My submission is a simple question. 
Using Slony to replicate one Database into another, there is few Stored procedures that need to be loaded thru Slony.

How can I include Comment lines.

Also how can I comment a portion of a line and let execute all rest?

Thanks,

TonyF

I suppose that if you can afford the cost, then all is well.

We have been cutting down on the costs, over time, not to the
fundamental degree of it no longer being quadratic in expansion, but
rather, but diminishing quantities of extra work.

For instance, in v2.0, sequence updates only take place when their
values actually change, which should greatly reduce the cost of having
many sequences replicated, particularly if only a few are heavily
used.

If you have a system that is relatively lightly loaded, then it may be
OK if replication is *relatively* pretty expensive, as long as it's
not actually too expensive for your resources to cope with.

As far as i know it will involve only a handful tables (with a less number 
of sequences), so this won't be an issue even in 1.2 i think.

Yeah, we are going to propose a test setup for know, we'll see.

Do you think it's worth to add a comment like your's above to the 
documentation, something along the line

"If you can assure your network resources are sufficient, it's likely to 
create clusters with much more nodes."

People likely get confused, since they interpret the current phrasing as a 
Slony-I limit. I'll can prepare a documentation patch, if you agree.

I think there is still a communication problem here. Are you talking 
about comments inside of PL/pgSQL stored procedures or are you talking 
about comments in slonik configuration scripts?

Try a CVS update; I think I have addressed them...

C is almost a real language. (see assembler) Even the name sounds like
it's gone through  an optimizing  compiler.  Get  rid of  all of those
stupid brackets and we'll talk. (see LISP)

Hi all,

The last time someone left Command Prompt, it took several months for
someone to pick up moderation.  I guess we don't want that again.

I believe that someone other than me is moderating all the lists at
the moment, but it might be good to get some diversity in here,
because I'm going to disappear (and I won't be available for
moderation in my new position, I'm afraid).

Volunteers or suggested victims are welcome ;-)  I won't be available
to do anything about this after 31 Oct., but Devrim and Joshua both
know the master password to the mailman instance.  Still, it'd be
better to have someone active in the project with that password as
well.

Let me know who should have it.

A

as you know I am keeping an eye on -commits, -bugs, -hackers and -patches ,
but only in the Administrative Database.

If you need some help in the Administrative Interface or deeper I can give
you a hand, so let me know what you think
