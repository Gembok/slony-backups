The patch seemed to address 1 things

1) Support for newer autoconfs, which seems to not break the older 2.59. 
  I am happy committing that portion of the patch (attached here, also 
available as commit b77b608d63cab2a4519f66f7436a29cc808b502a on the 
REL2_0_PROPOSED_ssinger branch at my git mirror 
(git://github.com/ssinger/slony.git) of the code.

2) The issue with the datatype to use for yyleng.  I would like to know 
the actual error your getting on osx and what version of flex it is 
using. If it really should be size_t then this patch isn't sufficient 
(we need to change all imports of yyleng) but as Jan points out that 
doesn't seem right on some platforms.

Can someone with easy access to an osx machine try building slony with 
the above autoconf patch applied and report on what is happening?

Thanks

According to Benjamin Reed, the patch author, osx expects yyleng to be
size_t.

Will do and report :)

It looks like flex changed the datatype they use around version 2.5.35 
(http://flex.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flex/flex/NEWS?revision=2.194&view=markup) 


I think I can replace our direct use of yyleng with calls to yyget_len() 
to avoid this issue

David, does this patch (in addition to the autoconf changes) get things 
working on your version of OSX? I've replaced uses of yyleng with 
yyget_len() and am having flex generate a proper prototype for it.

We are using a non-existant variable (typo) in ShouldSlonyVacuum.  This 
patch seems to fix that.

FYI, result of some discussion that should get exposed on list...

yyget_len() is available on modern versions of flex (at least as far 
back as 2.5.31, which is what PostgreSQL requires, of late).

So, I'm suggesting that configure be modified to check for 2.5.31 (or 
later), for which a sample test may be gotten from config/programs.m4 in 
the PostgreSQL tree.  Given that, it'll be very clear to people that 
have any difficulties that they're using a too-old flex.

I don't feel badly about going back as far as PostgreSQL does ;-).

I could do this change; it may be opportunity for Steve to improve his 
configure-foo.

That's better than putting some documentation somewhere saying "oh, by 
the way, you need to use version X of flex".
