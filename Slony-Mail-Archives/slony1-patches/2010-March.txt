Subject: [Slony1-patches] slony_extract_schema updates
Message-ID: <4BAA324E.4050501@ca.afilias.info>



Attached are two patches related to the slony_extract_schema scripts.

1. Ensures that the major version of pg_dump matches the major version
of the postgresql backend your connecting to.  We've seen some problems
with using a newer pg_dump against an older backend where some GRANT
statements error out resulting in missing permissions on in the
extracted schema

2. A script to handle preparing a schema for upgrading to a newer
version of postgresql.  This script calls the slony1_extract_schema
script and then restores the dump to the database and uses the newer
pg_dump to produce a dump suitable for a newer version of postgresql.

I think we can apply it.

We should look at applying this patch to 1.2.

It looks fine to me but I haven't done any testing on 8.4 with it applied.

            Summary: slonik loads old SQL into 8.4

Created an attachment (id=40)

patch to fix the issue

slonik doesn't know about versions >8.3 when deciding which
slony1_funcs.vXX.sql to load.  This is pretty critical because the 
autovacuum
setup was changed in 8.4, and so if the wrong file is loaded, stuff breaks.
Fix attached.

Jan did a slightly different change to this that was included in 1.2.20.

http://main.slony.info/viewcvs/viewvc.cgi/slony1-engine/src/slon/misc.c?r1=1.22.2.3&r2=1.22.2.4&pathrev=REL_1_2_STABLE

I've marked the issue as fixed, albeit not with the same patch.

Looks fine to me, too.

The test of whether it's working or not is fairly trivial.

You just need to start up a slon against an 8.4 database; if it's still
broken, it'll report that "it doesn't know about this version of
PostgreSQL." (Loosely worded...)
