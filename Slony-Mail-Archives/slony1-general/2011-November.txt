I think I was successfully  able to build recent slony 2.0.7 versions on 
Solaris with both gcc and the sun compiler.

Hello,

I have 2 postgresql servers, ONE is used for read and write
operations, while the OTHER is used for read only operations.

I want all updates for several tables on  ONE to be transferred to the OTHER.
In case the ONE or the OTHER goes off line or there is a connection
problems, I want those updates to be transferred as soon as server
goes on line.

Is it possible to perform such replication using Slony?
If it is so, where to dig? ;-)

Thanks in Advance,
Vitaliy S

Well, what Slony does sounds somewhat like an interpretation of this...

Supposing there are two servers:
 - Node #1, used for read and write, which is defined as the origin
 - Node #2, used only for read access, defined as subscriber/replica

That's a very standard Slony configuration.

If node #1 goes down, then there are two choices:

a) Wait until it comes back.  (e.g. - if the problem is a minor one).

In that case, updates will be transferred from #1 (origin) to #2
(subscriber) as soon as node #1 comes back on line.  (It may be
necessary to restart a slon process too; if it has some sort of
watchdog watching it, that's easy to make happen.  There's a script
for that...)

b) Give up on node #1 (e.g. - if the problem is a major one).

In that case, you need to submit a FAILOVER script (using
slony.info/documentation/2.1/stmtfailover.html) to turn node #2 into
the origin node.

At that point, node #1 is to be treated as destroyed.

There is no c)  :-)

Slony doesn't try to provide multimaster replication; while there are
ways of having *some* traffic going in both directions between nodes,
that needs to involve mutually disjoint sets of tables.

If case a) describes what you're thinking of, then Slony does what you
want.  If you're thinking of a "case c)," then perhaps not so much.

Hi Steven,

Thanks for the reply !

I faced issues in installing Slony on Solaris.

I tried compiling Slony binaries with Postgres binaries and was able to install it.

Thanks
VB

That's how slony works out of the box.  The only issue you may have is
if there is a slow WAN link between the servers, and you have lots and
lots of updates.  If there is a significant time of disconnection
between the two, the backlog of change may be too great to apply.
Sometimes it is faster to start from scratch in those situations.

Hi, we have one application connected to a local PostgreSql server and
we are facing the need to allow a remote site's users to use the
application. As a point-to-point connection is really expensive, we're
looking for other solutions, like replication.

On each site ~25 clients are connected to the server doing reads and
writes, and we would like to synchronize both servers, so, for example
if a new record is added on Site1, in about 15minutes, that record must
appear on Site2, and viceversa.

Is this possible with Slony-I?.

Thanks in advance,

Unfortunately, the "vice versa" part is not possible.

Slony-I is a *single* master to multiple subscribers replication
system; it does not try to address the multimaster problem.

What reasonably works is for site #1 to be the "master," and for that
data to appear reasonably quickly at site #2.

There are ways of approximating multimaster replication with Slony-I,
but it quickly gets pretty involved, and you need to effectively
design that into your application.
