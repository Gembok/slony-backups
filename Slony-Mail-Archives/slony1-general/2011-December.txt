Subject: [Slony1-general] Catch-up and sl_status, and yum repo
Message-ID: <CAAFQqzTxsFTEd679GCRnthPFgqnOAB_N=UF5QKHHDA+rNKud_w@mail.gmail.com>

We recently had an issue with a long Slony (2.0) catch-up after 10 days of
disconnect between a master and a slave. It's possible that it was caused
by either bug 167 or bug 222. To test this behavior we made a dummy cluster
on our local LAN, and did the following steps:

1. Initialize a two-node Slony cluster with two identical copies of the
database.
2. Allow initial subscription to catch up.
3. On the slave: drop the network connection to the master.
4. On the master: run ~4 million update operations.
5. On the slave: restore the connection to the master.

We did this, and I was able to watch sync events get submitted and received
in the logs. However, in sl_status, st_lag_num_events and st_lag_time kept
going up, and the backlogged changes were not propagated (after a couple of
hours, at least). The LAN link between the two nodes is fast, and neither
node is lagging due to server/IO/network load. Why is this occurring/what
did I do wrong?

Also, on what time period do you publish RPMs of Slony to public Yum
repositories? (i.e. when should we expect to see an RPM of Slony 2.1?)

Thanks!

Your 4 million row update was done as a single transaction.  This means 
that Slony needs to replicate it to the slave as part of a single SYNC. 
If slony is busy replicating that sync the SYNC won't show up as being 
replicated until that SYNC is done.  sl_status will show the slave as 
falling behind while the processing of that SYNC is going on (because it 
is behind, none of your 4 million rows will be visible on the slave 
until the transaction commits).

If you run the slon for your slave at debug4 you should see lots of 
DEBUG messages from the remoteWorkerThread showing progress.  Slony will 
fetch the rows in groups of 500 at a time with a cursor.  Based on how 
frequently you see these you can probably estimate how long it will take 
to do 4 million.

Packages are ready, I'll push them on Monday, along with the PostgreSQL
update releases.

Hi

I'm trying to get slony1-91 running on CentOS 5.7
using official postgre sql yum repository
current packages are
slony1-91-2.0.7-1.rhel5
postgresql91-9.1.1-1PGDG.rhel5
postgresql91-libs-9.1.1-1PGDG.rhel5
postgresql91-server-9.1.1-1PGDG.rhel5

When I try to run slonik it prints "Possible unsupported PostgreSQL
version (90101) 9.1, defaulting to 8.4 support".

Is it problem with my setup or a bug?

Regards,
Vitaliy S

This is expected behaviour. Slony 2.0.7 was released before 9.1 was 
released.  The only issue with running against 9.1 that I am (so far) aware 
of is discussed in this thread

Message-ID: <2BAB4106A6ADED49AE82F980249A60B0025A372B@01-nav-mail.navionics.it>

Dear all,

I'm using slony to have a replica of my database (Postgresql 8.4).

Currently I replicate only some tables, not the entire database. I was
wondering if it is possible to replicate only some records of a table,
for example according to some field's value. In other words, perform a
sort of conditional replica. 

 

Please let me know.

Thank you,

 

Laura Passigni

It is not in the features list of slony.
I don't think it is possible without rewriting triggers. Maybe have a
look at logtrigger().

No, although you could do this with views and some fancy underlying
tables, and then only replicate the particular tables you wanted the
records from.

It ought to become plausible after 2.2 is released.

We have the change (still being integrated in; I think Jan is planning
to get this into master this week; you can take a peek at the repos
for Jan/Steve/Myself at GitHub to see what things are looking like)
that the log data is being split apart rather differently, notably so
that the log data is no longer "cooked" into text, but is, instead,
kept as a series of arrays.

That should make it possible to inject a "hook" function into the log
application function to reinterpret what is to be done with the log
data.

The first aspect that we expect to be pretty easy is to replay data
into a different table/schema; that's extremely useful for the case
where people want to replicate several instances of an application
into a "consolidation database."  This just involves renaming the
target table, and I wouldn't expect this to be terribly difficult to
deal with.  It should be able to be handled pretty cleanly.
(Hopefully.)

But as a broader matter, it would be interesting to add in "hooks" to
do more sophisticated things such as:

- Renaming columns.  Describing the configuration well is likely to be
the hard part.

- Selective replication, based on interpreting the data that is
provided.  Given a "hook" function to override the built-in behaviour,
it should surely be possible to do "just about anything."  Though the
higher the flights of fancy, the wiser this likely isn't...

Rewriting the triggers, as they exist now, seems horribly unattractive
to me.  They're SPI C functions, and there's enough intricacy there
that I'd think it pretty dangerous to hack on them without a pretty
deep understanding of them.  But this changes in 2.2...

Sure! Andrew' solution is way better at the moment.
Very nice features are planned, good to hear.
