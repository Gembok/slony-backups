Subject: [Slony1-general] Query to see when Slony is done replicating
	changes?
Message-ID: <7742DD496427B743BC8B7BBF6D380BA037766C7D@EXCHANGE10.geo-comm.local>

Hello,

I'm wondering if its possible to query any of the databases in my cluster to see when Slony is done replicating changes to a single node.  I was going to use the Acks Outstanding statistic but then realized that the slave nodes that my controller service is waiting to update (and do not have Slony running on) will keep adding to that count.  If there is no statistic to query, is my assumption that tables are replicated in the order they are added to the replication set correct?

As for why I can't just let the changes replicate to all slaves at once, it is because of a no single point of failure for the web app that is reading the replicated data.
