thanks a lot, this solved the "receiver does not exist"-problem. both master
and slave start without any errors now.

read about that already. will keep it in mind. but pgadmin is for now the
best way for me to check what is going on. further comparing the old and the
new server replication wise.



What still bothers me, is that the replication set on the master-DB states
24 tables. this is ok. but the replication set on the slave does not state
any abonnements/subscriptions (to these tables). I think there should be an
abonnement/subscription. like this (on the old server - pgadmin sql field):

-- subscribe replication set

 SELECT _fquest.subscribeset(1, 1, 2, false);

thanks for your help, really appreciated.

Cheers,
Marcus
