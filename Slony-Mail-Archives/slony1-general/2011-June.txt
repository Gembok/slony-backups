Subject: [Slony1-general]  Verifying Data Consistency with Slony?
Message-ID: <31787795.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello and thanks for taking the time to read my post...

I'm using Slony-I v1.2.20 and I have a simple master/slave replication
occurring between two servers.  Recently, we had a bit of an interruption to
our network and I need to verify the consistency of the data between the two
databases. I've checked the logs for any outstanding errors, but they seem
to report that everything is running fine.  

Aside form using sql queries, is there any way to check data consistency
using slony (ie ensure that the tables are in fact replicated 1:1)?

Thanks for your help in advance!

Cheers,
Jason
