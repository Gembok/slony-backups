Subject: [Slony1-general] change password
Message-ID: <10925035.957191328189418573.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,
I?m using a Postgresql database version: 8.4 and I have some tables in replica 
between two servers with slony 2.0.6.
I need, for security issues, to change the password of the master database. Is 
there a way to change the password stored in the cluster without stopping the 
replica and start again from the beginning? 

Thank you

Francesco

Subject: [Slony1-general] What is the behavior of slony wait for event after
	lock set command.
Message-ID: <1328202815.77163.YahooMailNeo@web122511.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

We are trying  to do a swith over and it is taking a lot of time. 


We are following the following steps to perform switchover:
	1. Lock Set
	2. Wait for Event (timout = 300)
	3. Move Set (timeout = 300)
	4. Wait for Event (timout = 300)
The alt perl script we have with slony source has the following sequence:
	1. Lock Set
	2. Sync
	3. Wait for Event
	4. Move Set
What should be the correct sequence of event and how can I make switchover faster.

Regards

Sure, you can submit STORE PATH with the new password, and that will
propagate across the cluster.  (Likely several requests, one for each
communications path.)

It is considered better form to use a .pgpass file, so passwords are not
visible in slony configuration altogether.

You will also need to revise the configuration used to launch slon
processes.  Look for slon.conf in the documentation.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony 2.0.x and PostgreSQL 9.1
Message-ID: <4F2B3552.9000007@ca.afilias.info>

Those of you paying attention noticed that I just released 1.2.23 and 
2.1.1 but not 2.0.8

We had applied the fix for bug #255 the 'serialization conflicts with 
PostgreSQL 9.1' on the 2.0 branch in addition to the 2.1 branch.

When testing 2.0.8 RC2 I noticed that once in a while the disorder - 
"MoveSet" test in the clustertest framework gave me failures where the 
nodes could end up with different data.   The MoveSet test does 11 move 
sets between nodes in the cluster.  If I run the MoveSet test in a loop 
10 times I would typicaly get one failed test run.

On the version before the bug #255 commit I was never able to reproduce 
that failure on many runs.

I have also not been able to reproduce that failure on the 2.1.1 with 
which includes a fix for #255. (which is why I released 2.1.1)

(All of the above is with PostgreSQL 9.1).

My inclination is to take out the fix for #255 from 2.0.8 and also put 
back in the warning about 9.1 "might be unsupported" that you would see 
with 2.0.7.

We can also leave the bug #255 fix in and put the warning back.

If someone can figure out why this is failing in 2.0 then we do talk 
about addressing that.  I can't rule out it being a problem in the test 
itself, but nothing pops out at me  (A version of the disorder tests 
back-ported to 2.0 can be found at 
https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/tree/REL_2_0_STABLE-clustertest)

Subject: [Slony1-general] Cascading replication using altperl scripts.
Message-ID: <CF3E1A49FFAA4204A0F503E17D390913@CMOTUM25PC>

Hello list:

My name is Efrain and this week I?ve been using Slony-I, with the help of the documentation I?ve been able to setup replication between 2 nodes using slonik scripts and also with altperl scripts. For me, using altperl scritps is more comfortable but now I?m stucked trying to set cascading replication. I have this in mind:

    A1 ?> B1 ?> B2

Meaning that A1 would be the master to B1 but also B1 would be master of B2. My slon_tools.conf looks like this:

add_node(node     => 1,
         host     => '192.168.1.231',
         dbname   => 'prueba',
         port     => 5432,
         user     => 'postgres',
         password => '1');

add_node(node     => 2,
         host     => '192.168.1.232',
         dbname   => 'prueba',
         port     => 5432,
         noforward => allow,
         user     => 'pgsql',
         password => '2');

add_node(node     => 3,
         parent   => 2,
         host     => '192.168.1.233',
         dbname   => 'prueba',
         port     => 5432,
         user     => 'pgsql',
         password => '3');

I understand that B1 shall be configured to accept forward but I don?t now how to do this.

Any help would be really appreciated.

Thank you.

Hello,

I'm working on a project where we are using pg_dump to get the data out of one database and then using psql to load it into another.  The second database is the master db in a Slony replication cluster.  However, no matter what options I specify in pg_dump the changes are not being replicated.  I've use a standard dump which uses COPY, a --inserts dump which uses insert into & a --insert-columns dump which adds column names to the insert into statements.  However, if I edit the data in pgAdmin III using the view option for the table, that change is replicated just fine.  What is the difference between editing the data that way in pgAdmin III and using psql to load a dump file?

Is there any possibility you made your dump with --disable-triggers ?
