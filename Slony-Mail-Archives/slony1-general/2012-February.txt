Subject: [Slony1-general] change password
Message-ID: <10925035.957191328189418573.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,
I?m using a Postgresql database version: 8.4 and I have some tables in replica 
between two servers with slony 2.0.6.
I need, for security issues, to change the password of the master database. Is 
there a way to change the password stored in the cluster without stopping the 
replica and start again from the beginning? 

Thank you

Francesco

Subject: [Slony1-general] What is the behavior of slony wait for event after
	lock set command.
Message-ID: <1328202815.77163.YahooMailNeo@web122511.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

We are trying  to do a swith over and it is taking a lot of time. 


We are following the following steps to perform switchover:
	1. Lock Set
	2. Wait for Event (timout = 300)
	3. Move Set (timeout = 300)
	4. Wait for Event (timout = 300)
The alt perl script we have with slony source has the following sequence:
	1. Lock Set
	2. Sync
	3. Wait for Event
	4. Move Set
What should be the correct sequence of event and how can I make switchover faster.

Regards

Sure, you can submit STORE PATH with the new password, and that will
propagate across the cluster.  (Likely several requests, one for each
communications path.)

It is considered better form to use a .pgpass file, so passwords are not
visible in slony configuration altogether.

You will also need to revise the configuration used to launch slon
processes.  Look for slon.conf in the documentation.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony 2.0.x and PostgreSQL 9.1
Message-ID: <4F2B3552.9000007@ca.afilias.info>

Those of you paying attention noticed that I just released 1.2.23 and 
2.1.1 but not 2.0.8

We had applied the fix for bug #255 the 'serialization conflicts with 
PostgreSQL 9.1' on the 2.0 branch in addition to the 2.1 branch.

When testing 2.0.8 RC2 I noticed that once in a while the disorder - 
"MoveSet" test in the clustertest framework gave me failures where the 
nodes could end up with different data.   The MoveSet test does 11 move 
sets between nodes in the cluster.  If I run the MoveSet test in a loop 
10 times I would typicaly get one failed test run.

On the version before the bug #255 commit I was never able to reproduce 
that failure on many runs.

I have also not been able to reproduce that failure on the 2.1.1 with 
which includes a fix for #255. (which is why I released 2.1.1)

(All of the above is with PostgreSQL 9.1).

My inclination is to take out the fix for #255 from 2.0.8 and also put 
back in the warning about 9.1 "might be unsupported" that you would see 
with 2.0.7.

We can also leave the bug #255 fix in and put the warning back.

If someone can figure out why this is failing in 2.0 then we do talk 
about addressing that.  I can't rule out it being a problem in the test 
itself, but nothing pops out at me  (A version of the disorder tests 
back-ported to 2.0 can be found at 
https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/tree/REL_2_0_STABLE-clustertest)
