patch

There are many bashisms and other nonportable shell features used in the
various scripts in the slony tree.  Most of them are easily fixable.  In other
cases, it might be easier to change #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash.

I have attached a patch that should fix a number of those problems.

Thanks, Peter!

It applied nicely against CVS HEAD, and I ran some of the regression tests
successfully, so it seems safe enough to commit.

I tried applying it to the 1.2 branch with less success; I think I'll leave
this as a "HEAD enhancement," unless people have great objections...

I had been putting this off, as it seemed as though it might be undesirable to
make a change that might be interpreted as commending use of mechanisms other
than EXECUTE SCRIPT to manage changes to tables.

In retrospect, the other changes in v2.0 make that counter-issue go away. 
EXECUTE SCRIPT doesn't run the functions that continually alter this "Morse
code" anymore.

I have attached a patch against CVS HEAD that seems to handle how the code is
now...

Note that I have added an example of a table that exercises this logic to
test1.

Jacques, could you review this versus HEAD to verify that the changes to
src/backend/slony1_funcs.c are already in the code?  Thanks!

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] A possible bug in Slony test_slony_state-dbi.pl
Message-ID: <65937bea0807100414k7f4b0833r486e1113d6a2f50c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

    I am no expert in either Slony or Perl, but it seems to me that the perl
script should be connecting to each node in turn and then executing the
test_node script; but it is not. The script performs only one connection
throughout it's lifetime, and that is to the $initialDSN. The docs at
http://www.slony.info/documentation/monitoring.html say:

<snip>
The script then rummages through sl_path to find all of the nodes in the
cluster, and the DSNs to allow it to, in turn, connect to each of them.
</snip>

Is it possible that I am using an old version of the scripts? I took the
script from:

http://main.slony.info/viewcvs/viewvc.cgi/slony1-engine/tools/test_slony_st=
ate-dbi.pl?revision=3D1.5&content-type=3Dtext%2Fplain

  and the $Id $ tag says:

# $Id: test_slony_state-dbi.pl,v 1.5 2007/01/02 19:34:11 cbbrowne Exp $


    Here's a patch to fix the test_node function, if you consider this to be
a bug:

Forgot the fix to the dsn string. I am not sure if we should be replacing
the spaces in the dsn string with a semicolon, so I'll leave that decision
upto the hackers.

A newer version. Instead of dying upon connection failure, it registers a
problem so that the problem can be reported at the end.

A note for the archive readers: I noticed that every 'equal to' sign is
being shown as 'equal to3D'in the archives, so if you are trying to pick up
this patch from archives, do proper search/replce before applying this
patch.

Better still!

Thanks, I'll be committing this momentarily.

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] [Bug 55] New: Possible buffer overflow in slon,
 still happens as of 1.2.14
Message-ID: <bug-55-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55

           Summary: Possible buffer overflow in slon, still happens as of
                    1.2.14
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 1.2
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: minor
          Priority: low
         Component: slon
        AssignedTo: slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info
        ReportedBy: ahodgson@simkin.ca
                CC: slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info
   Estimated Hours: 0.0


Once in a while, I experience a problem replicating a new set, where the slon
remote worker thread is terminated by a signal 11.

I'm not much of a C programmer, so I haven't been able to patch this myself.

I don't know how much of the following is relevant, but here is what I do know:

It only occurs when debugging is set at 2 or higher. 

According to strace, the last thing the process does before receiving the sig
11 is output the log entry "syncing set %d with %d table(s) from provider %d\n"
(with real data of course), which appears to be called from remote_worker.c at
line 4232. The log entry is fully output before the thread is killed.

In my case, it always happens on set id 100, which I use as a temporary set
when adding new tables and sequences, and only on the first sync of the set
after subscribing it to a new node.

Reducing the debugging to 0 has so far gotten past the issue all 3 times it has
happened, and later syncs at a higher debug level work fine. It's not
reproducible except at the specific time it's happening (ie. I don't have a
test case that can demonstrate it).

I've looked at the logging code and can't see a buffer issue in it. I think
probably it's just causing an interaction with the real problem elsewhere.

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] A minor bug-fix left-out in version 1.5
Message-ID: <65937bea0807281642i23032dd0nc9d7fd412e59a17c@mail.gmail.com>

I notice that version 1.5 of the test_slony_state-dbi.pl script fixed a
problem where the diagnosis messages would not show which node the
long-running transactions were running. But the 'add_problem()' function
call of that code still has the first parameter as $origin, which I think is
a copy-paste error from previous blocks of 'while' loops. This causes the
emails sent out to be confusing as to which node the problem is being
reported for!

Here's a patch that fixes it. It also fixes another annoying this I have to
edit out every time I download this script to make it excutable; it removes
the # -*- perl -*- comment from the first line.
