           Summary: slony doesn't escape varchar fields properly, making it
                    impossible to replicate varchar or bytea columns in some
                    cases

I have a very simple table:

create table foo(z varchar not null, bar int not null, primary key(z));

now, I try to insert bunch of data to it using:
insert into foo(bar, z) select generate_series(1,100) as bar, encode(
gen_random_bytes(100), 'escape') as z;

on slon's insert db will reply:
ERROR:  invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0xdf15

which is quite right, since data is not escaped. I am inserting random data, on
purpose - because we do have that in here, and it works fine with my C code,
that so far replicated the data.

Further more, I think if slony would use PQexecParams instead of PQexec to
insert data, that problem wouldn't arose in first place.

Followup question:

What are the encodings of the two databases (e.g. - origin + subscriber)?

My suspicion is that either:

a) Both use UTF-8, but the origin is on PostgreSQL 7.4 or 8.0, which had
problems with its handling of Unicode encoding validation, or

b) The origin is using SQL-ASCII or similar, and the subscriber is using
Unicode/UTF-8.

If either of those speculations are in fact the case, then this may NOT be a
bug; Slony-I does not promise to do inter-encoding translations.

http://slony.info claims this bug was fixed in 1.2.15. Should this bug report
be closed now, or are there still outstanding issues?

this is on 8.1, yes - db is obviously encoded in UTF8. Same problem  
persists if I just dump and restore db with psql.
I suspect that pg is maybe here to blame - as it allowed me to insert  
that data in first place, but I think also that slony should escape  
all data on insert, plus use pgexecparam, as it is giving you escaping  
for free, essentially.

Preferred would be to include an option that permits invocation with the
password read from a protected file, so as not to expose it to unprivileged
Linux users.

The use of .pgpass is already recommended in the FAQ.
