           Summary: Slony log shipper doesn't parse TRUNCATE

           Version: devel
          Platform: PC

This bug applies to 2.1 and master (2.2)

Slony 2.1 added support for replicating TRUNCATE commands.

The slony_logshipper daemon has a parser.y that it uses to parse the log ship
files generated by slon.  The grammer in this file (and associated handling
code) can not deal with TRUNCATE commands.

You get the following error
ERROR 2011-11-04 15:55:28 >
/tmp/logreformat/slony1_log_4_00000000000000000139.sql:12: ERROR syntax error
at or near TRUNCATE

from a line in the log file like:
TRUNCATE ONLY "disorder"."do_item_review" CASCADE;

           Summary: Log shipper targets can't add sequences after initial
                    setup
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 2.0
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW

The slony1_dump.sh creates a sl_sequence_offline table for tracking sequences
on a log shipping target.

If you add+subscribe a new sequence to a new set after the log shipping slave
has been setup then the slon generating the log ship files will not generate
any SQL to update sl_sequence_offline to reflect the new sequence.  Updates to
the sequence then fail on the log shipping target.

I have changes to the LogShipping.js disorder test to replicate this issue that
I will include with the fix.

I think 2.0 2.1 and 2.2 all have this bug (I haven't looked at the log shipping
code in 1.2)

Fix for bug 248

This is a fix for bug248.
It was developed against REL_2_1_STABLE but should apply against 2.0 (excluding
the unit test change)

We also have no code to drop sequences from the _offline tracking table in
response to a DROP_SET or DROP_SEQUENCE.  This sounds like it could cause
problems if later you add the set/sequence back again.

Also if someone changes the name of the sequence via EXECUTE SCRIPT things will
again break.

Why are we tracking the relationship between the sequence id and the sequence
name?  Would we be better off not passing the name instead of the id to
sequenceSetValue_offline?  Does anyone remember the reason why the tracking
table was added in the first place?

Alternate fix, stop using the sequence table

An alternate fix for bug248. This stops tracking sequences in a table and
instead includes the sequence name (from the node running the slon that
generates the log ship files) in the .SQL files.

I do not feel this patch is suitable for 2.1.x or 2.0.x because it changes the
arguments of functions + eliminates a table.  I think it is the preferred
approach for 2.2

Another related question is how do we tell users of log shipping what SQL they
need to execute against the log shipping target node to apply these changes.

I can attach a SQL command list to the bug but does that go in the manual? In a
shell script like slony1_dump.sh?

Add OMIT_COPY option to slony1_dump.sh to support upgrades

To address the upgrade problem I have modified slony1_dump.sh to do a dump
without the data.  The upgrade instructions would be
1. stop the slon
2. drop schema $clustername cascade; from the log ship target
3. slony1_dump.sh -omit_copy
4. restart the slons.

Log shipping should resume from where it left off but with the new slony
version.
