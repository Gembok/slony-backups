Message-ID: <bug-114-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=114

           Summary: slony1_extract.sh doesn't check the version of pg_dump
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 1.2
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW

tools/slony1_extract.sh uses the pg_dump (and psql) executables from the users
path.  It does not check to see that the pg_dump in your path matches the
version of the backend you are pointing to.

slony1_extract.sh will do a pg_dump (with options) against the backend and then
restore the schema against a temp database against the same backend.  Your
pg_dump binary must be from the same major postgresql version as the backend
your restoring to.   Using the 8.3 pg_dump to dump then restore to a 8.1
backend will not work (for sequence permissions won't get loaded).

This also means that you can't use the slony1_extract script to dump a schema
from one postgresql version on restore it on another.  You would have to load
the output of slony1_extract into the older pg backend and then do a second
dump with the newer pg_dump.

WAIT FOR EVENT commands are not allowed inside of a try block since the new
confirm messages won't become visible inside of the transaction.

Doing this tends to result in the deadlocks of your slonik scripts.

Slonik should be enhanced to detect this situation after it has parsed the
script and error out.

patch to fix the issue

slonik doesn't know about versions >8.3 when deciding which
slony1_funcs.vXX.sql to load.  This is pretty critical because the autovacuum
setup was changed in 8.4, and so if the wrong file is loaded, stuff breaks. 
Fix attached.

This still bites us when I don't rebuild our packages with the above patch. It
will happen anytime someone does a sufficiently large set subscription with
debugging level of 2 or higher.

Is there anything else I can do to encourage upstream merging of this fix?

It took me two days to find Paul's patch. Finally I also managed to make my
boss regain confidence in Slony-I. A signal 11 was the blocker for our move
with multiple big databases.

Slony-I is a really important software for PostgreSQL infrastructures. Please,
don't let it be unappreciated because of 'slon: child terminated status: 11'.

Jan implemented this in a slightly shorter fashion in 1.2.20:

http://main.slony.info/viewcvs/viewvc.cgi/slony1-engine/src/slon/misc.c?r1=1.22.2.3&r2=1.22.2.4&pathrev=REL_1_2_STABLE

The issue is certainly present in 1.2.15 and 1.2.16, but it shouldn't be as of
1.2.20.

Jan did a slightly different change to this that was included in 1.2.20.

http://main.slony.info/viewcvs/viewvc.cgi/slony1-engine/src/slon/misc.c?r1=1.22.2.3&r2=1.22.2.4&pathrev=REL_1_2_STABLE

I've marked the issue as fixed, albeit not with the same patch.

The fix from Jan will not address this problem. The problem is that the va_list
"ap" gets reused by a new call to vsnprintf() when outbuf is too small and has
to be realloc'd. Since vsnprintf has to read the contents of ap, ap becomes
undefined after it returns.

If you want to use the list of variable arguments multiple times (i.e., call
vsnprintf multiple times), you must copy it using va_copy().

I can verify that it is still in 1.2.20; we were bit by it just last week, when
I posted my comment, and we run 1.2.20.

This has been fixed in both the 1.2 and 2.0 branch.

The slony1_extract_schema.sh script will now compare the pg backend major
version against the pg_dump major version

I have committed this patch against 1.2 and 2.0 CVS.

I also added a test case to the utf8 test case that seems to reproduce the
crash without the patch.

> Is there anything that I can help you to debug this issue?

Can you clarify what your seeing.

If I start up on the same postgresql cluster 
1) 1 slon on my origin database
2) 1 slon on my receiver database
3) A second slon on my receiver database

The third slon gives me
----------------------------------------------
2010-03-31 10:31:44 EDTFATAL  localListenThread: "select
"_test".cleanupNodelock(); insert into "_test".sl_nodelock values (    2, 0,
"pg_catalog".pg_backend_pid()); " - ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique
constraint "sl_nodelock-pkey"

2010-03-31 10:31:44 EDTINFO   slon: shutdown requested
2010-03-31 10:31:44 EDTINFO   slon: notify worker process to shutdown

-----------------------------------------------------------

and exits.   Isn't this the behavior one would expect, or are you seeing
something else?

The report by Shahaf Abileah doesn't seem to me to indicate an error; if you
try to run a slon on 2 servers, then there's no way to find, via /usr/bin/ps,
that there were two instances.  That case doesn't seem like a bug to me - it
looks instead like the slon is working correctly.  The only possible change
would be to catch the exception and give a more explicit warning to the effect
that "it looks like you have a slon running already!"

Bill Moran's report isn't about the same thing.

In his case, the attempt to start another slon leads to the same symptom (e.g.
- slon complains that it can't get the exclusive lock on the tuple).

The *problem*, however, seems to be that the "old" slon has gotten somehow
'wedged,' and I'd think it likely that the problem is that it's waiting for a
lock to be granted.

What's likely necessary to diagnose the issue is a query against pg_locks on
the node being managed showing what the "stalled" connection is waiting on.
