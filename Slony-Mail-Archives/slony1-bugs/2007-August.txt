Subject: [Slony1-bugs] servers in different timezones disrupts log cleaning
Message-ID: <20070824100811.GA66056@sanatana.dharma>

when servers are in different timezones (my are 7 hours away) sl_log_1/2
and event logs are not cleaned as they should.

I discovered that all timestamps in tables like sl_event, sl_confirm are in
server local time not UTC. Some functions like cleanupevent() are comparing
timestamps against local time and this dont work well as expected if remote server timestamps are 7 hours away.
