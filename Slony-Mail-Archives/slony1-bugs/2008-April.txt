           Summary: EXECUTE SCRIPT runs on ALL nodes
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 1.2
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW

Hello

I'm running 1.2.9 (altough this seems to be accurate for CVS too) against pg
1.2. I just did an EXECUTE SCRIPT with a simple ALTER command. I have two sets,
three nodes. Two masteres (1 and 2), with one set each, replicates each set to
the one single slave (101).
The ALTER was performed on set 1, with no "EXECUTE ONLY ON" parameter.
So, what I expected here was that the ALTER command should be executed on node
1 and node 101, and node2 not touched. But instead the slon running against
node2 borked. Looking at the logs, it showed that it was trying to run the
ALTER TABLE command against that database. Which ofcourse failed since that
database did not have set 1 (this one was master for set 2).

Looking closer I found
http://slony.info/documentation/function.ddlscript-prepare-int-integer-integer.html
and in particular this part:

        if v_set_origin <> v_no_id
                        and not exists (select 1 from sl_subscribe
                                                where sub_set = p_set_id
                                                and sub_receiver = v_no_id)
        then
                return 0;
        end if;


Now if im right here, that would be pseudocode :

IF the origin node for this set is not me, AND i dont subscribe to this set,
then abort without errors..

Now.. that sounds wrong? Shouldnt that be 


IF the origin node for this set is not me, OR i dont subscribe to this set,
then abort without errors..


Do I just need to sleep and check my subscription setups (which looks fine to
me in sl_subscribe, node 2 is not a subscriber of ANYTHING), or is this wrong?

In the meantime I guess one can run EXECUTE ONLY ON=101, which isnt very much
problem here in my dev setup, but more of a problem when you have many slaves i
guess.

Otherwise, thanks for a, even if somewhat tricky to administer, product! :) 

Regards
Johan

I don't have any more information about your problem.  However your question
about whether an OR or an AND is required in the code you quoted I can answer. 
It is definitely AND that you want there.  Using OR would lead to the query
never being executed on any of the slaves (as they would all answer yes to "Am
I not the origin of this set").

Yes, good point. I guess if it should be an OR it should read:

IF the origin node for this set IS me, OR i dont subscribe to this set,
then abort without errors..

or in sql:

        if v_set_origin = v_no_id
                        or not exists (select 1 from sl_subscribe
                                                where sub_set = p_set_id
                                                and sub_receiver = v_no_id)
        then
                return 0;
        end if;

No, that logic would lead to execution on the slaves that are subscribed to
that set only.  The origin would exit as well as any other nodes in the
cluster.

I believe that the original logic is correct.  So that means that either this
piece of code is not the cause of your problem or there is another bug in there
somewhere.

If you are still not sure can you try executing some of the code in
ddlscript_prepare_int (with your real values) and check that it all follows.

Ah, the masters execute this way to, then it makes sense. I guess I just needed
to sleep hehe. 

Well, I tried the ddlscript_prepare_int(1, -1); and it gave the expected
results.. So I guess the problem lies somewhere else... I don't really have
time to dig too deep in this right now though :/
If anyone else might try, or if you got some quick pointers to what I could
test?

Applied to CVS HEAD, with:

- A shift of the section to *after* the section that does things using 'raw'
slonik scripts

- Some rewording

According to the following patch that is likely to be applied...

http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2008-04/msg00425.php

SerializableSnapshot, as global symbols, are no more.  This will require a
further change to slony1_funcs.c

Note that the change to src/xxid/xxid.c is unnecessary as the whole
src/xxid/xxid.c "tree" has been eliminated from CVS HEAD as equivalent
functionality is in the PostgreSQL core in v8.3+.

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] Cache lookup failure when starting slony
Message-ID: <47FB6578.9060006@streamtech.nl>

Hi,

We are in the process of testing slony for replicating master-> single 
slave for now.
While testing it on static backup versions of our live database  we 
never ran into  problems.  Also while running it with postgresql-8.1 and 
slony1-bin 1.2.1-1 we experienced no strange behavior.
We are running debian etch and recently upgraded to postgresql-8.3 with 
slony1-bin 1.2.13-1 from debian sid.
By using the "by-hand" method of running slony we suddenly got this 
error in our frontend from postgresql:


[Mon Apr 07 13:00:59 2008] [error] [Hunchentoot] Database error XX000: 
cache lookup failed for type 76787


This was instantly fixed by stopping slony and using slonik to uninstall 
both nodes. To try to replicate the error i've set up a test again where 
the master db is static and not processing any queries. by inserting it 
with the query that caused the above error message nothing strange 
happend...
We also didn't see any messages in the slony logs that could be related.

I would like to test slony once more on our live db server but we can't 
really afford to run into this bug again. Looking at the replication 
solutions for pg we think slony would be the best solution for us, hope 
someone has a clue:)


Regards,

Gersom
