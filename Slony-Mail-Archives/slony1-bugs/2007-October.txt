Hooray on the fix.

But, I wasn't surprised at all to find out what was causing the deadlock as it 
was the products and man tables which were being used in the search queries. 
:-(

There is a flaw in the slonik_build_env.pl script. The print test should 
be >=1 and not > 1. It currently will not print databases where there 
are only single tables or sequences.


So, it should be:

if ( scalar(@tablesWithIndexes) >= 1 ) {
  print '@KEYEDTABLES=(' . "\n";
  foreach my $table (sort @tablesWithIndexes) {
    print "\t\"$table\",\n";
  }
  print ");\n";
}
if ( scalar(@tablesWithoutIndexes) >= 1 ) {
  print '@SERIALTABLES=(' . "\n";
  foreach my $table (sort @tablesWithoutIndexes) {
    print "\t\"$table\",\n";
  }
  print ");\n";
}
if ( scalar(@sequences) >= 1 ) {
  print '@SEQUENCES=(' . "\n";
  foreach my $table (sort @sequences) {
    print "\t\"$table\",\n";
  }
  print ");\n";
}

You're right. I've created a patch with your changes plus a fix to repair 
the -schema option, which was broken, too, and cc'ed slony1-patches so 
someone can review and apply it.

Note that slonik_build_environment is called slonik_build_env only, the 
former was removed.

Nonsens, confused that with show_configuration.pl, forget about this.
