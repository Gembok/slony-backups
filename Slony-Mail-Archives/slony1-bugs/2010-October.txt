           Summary: schemadoc.xml missing from 2.0.5 distribution
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 2.0
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All

   Estimated Hours: 0.0


The 2.0.5 distribution tarball no longer contains doc/adminguide/schemadoc.xml.
 I'm not sure if that was intentional, but it makes building the Debian package
pretty difficult, because I can't reasonably start a database server to run
autodoc during the build process.

No this was an issue in building the tar

I've rebuilt the tar and pushed it again to the downloads directory

hi,

I've downloaded Slony-I 2.0.5 source ball from official site.
http://slony.info/

then, I tried to build it on RHEL 5.
but I could not compile scan.c in src/slony_logshipper because it's not there.

configure message says I don't need to worry about Flex version.

*** Without Flex you will not be able to build Slony-I from CVS nor
*** change any of the scanner definition files.  You can obtain Flex from
*** a GNU mirror site.  (If you are using the official distribution of
*** Slony-I then you do not need to worry about this because the Flex
*** output is pre-generated.) 

did I make a mistake?

regards,

No you didn't do anything wrong.   The distclean rule seems to delete this file
so they don't get included in the tar files.

You can:

Install flex and bison on the system you are using to compile slony.  Your RHEL
5 cd should have packages for them.  Slony should then build

If you can't do this I can attach these files to the bug and you can manually
put them in the slony_logshipper directory.

We should fix the Makefiles before we do the next release.

The attached fix for the makefiles should keep these files around when a
distclean is done so they should be around in tarfiles in the future.

Hi, 

By for now, I'll install newer Flex and build Slony.

And Thank you for your fixing makefiles.
I'm looking forward to next release.

With 2.0.5 I've seen slon get into a state where it generates many megabytes
per second of log messages of the form

2010-10-21 18:52:32 CUTCONFIG slon: child terminated status: 589833; pid: -1,
current worker pid: 639202
2010-10-21 18:52:32 CUTCONFIG slon: child terminated status: 589833; pid: -1,
current worker pid: 639202

there does not appear to be a working slon running just the watchdog.
I had to send a kill -9 to the slon process to get it to stop.

It is possible that this was caused by some abnormal event ie dropping the
databases underneath slon but I'm not able to confirm that coincided with slon
getting into that state.

Note this was observed on AIX.

Proposed patch

Proposed patch for bug #160.

How do we feel about having the watchdog slon bail if it gets unexpected
results 
from wait?  Are there other situations where wait will return a -1 pid and we 
would still recover later?

Do we want to try and kill the worker slon in this case or not?

Patch to fix this issue.

When executing DDL script using the EXECUTE SCRIPT command, multi-line
statements are not handled correctly. When a line is longer than subsequent
lines, concatenation does not work.

An example statement:

ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN

I've looked over the patch.

I'm wondering if we shouldn't try to print a more helpful error message.

Would we not be friendlier if we printed the names of the tables (both as
listed in sl_table and as listed in pg_class as part of the slon output.

Asking the user to check the postgresql.log is kind of a pain (for them).

We also might want to explicitly mention REPAIR CONFIG in the error message.

alternate patch for 161

This is an alternate way of fixing the bug.
I think the real issue is that the length passed to memcpy doesn't account for
the terminating null character.

I'm not convinced the other patch will work if the first line is 256 characters
long.

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] [Bug 162] New: typenameTypeId() changes signatures
Message-ID: <bug-162-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

           Summary: typenameTypeId() changes signatures
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 2.0
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: low
         Component: slon
        AssignedTo: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
        ReportedBy: cbbrowne at ca.afilias.info
                CC: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
   Estimated Hours: 0.0


In PostgreSQL HEAD, the function typenameTypeId() has been refactored:

http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=35670340f57d78d6ab023b1fb42fd81339f85d4c

"Split the old typenameTypeId() into two functions: A new typenameTypeId() that
returns only a type OID, and typenameTypeIdAndMod() that returns type OID and
typmod.  This isolates call sites better that actually care about the typmod."

Some change is necessary, and presumably will include modifying autoconf
scripts to detect the change in API.

Patch to DDL script test

I added a multiline statement of the appropriate form into the DDL test; it
completes fine.

I suspect what we need, instead, is to have a sample DDL statement that is
rather a lot longer, e.g.  about 300 bytes long.

Steve's patch seems more general in purpose to me...

I have done all of this...

- slon pulls the warning messages using PQresultErrorMessage(), and displays
them in its logs.

- I augmented the health check function to suggest that REPAIR CONFIG might fix
the problem.

It's been signalled, and we don't really know why...  That bodes badly for the
slon.

That seems a rather deranged condition to get into; if threads are not shutting
down properly, that seems like an excellent case for right well shutting the
slon down, as opposed to trying to survive.
