Subject: [Slony1-patches] Truncate Trigger Support
Message-ID: <1201715367.4453.136.camel@ebony.site>

Enclosed is a trial patch for Slony CVS HEAD to implement replication
using Truncate Triggers. (A patch for truncate triggers has just been
submitted to pgsql-patches@postgresql.org)

This compiles, but I haven't tested this further. No docs.

I'm hoping for some review comments and then assistance with building
tests.

Implementation seeks to minimise changes to existing Slony message
output...

Thanks,
