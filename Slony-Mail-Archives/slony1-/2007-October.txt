Subject: [Slony1-patches] Check for superuser privledges
Message-ID: <1193410953.7976.3.camel@dbi-ubuntu-gateway>

To help guard against strange install errors the following patch
(REL_1_2_STABLE) implements superuser checking for slonik.

Baring any objections, I'll apply this later on today.

You're right. I've created a patch with your changes plus a fix to repair 
the -schema option, which was broken, too, and cc'ed slony1-patches so 
someone can review and apply it.

Note that slonik_build_environment is called slonik_build_env only, the 
former was removed.

  Thanks

Nonsens, confused that with show_configuration.pl, forget about this.

[Chris tries not to consider mooning the patch.  ;-)]

The only thought I have after looking at it is that perhaps there
should be an "ERROR:" in there somewhere.
